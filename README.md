# Susan [BEGINNER LEVEL]
Susan is a simple AI created to replicate a child of about 2 years old.
- Susan can respond via an audio file of a child talking in 51 different (all indexed in /topicOutputs
- Susan's vocabulary is based on words a child around 2 years of age should know
- Susan is a work in progress
- A list of all topics can be found in topicIndex.txt

#How she works
Susan was look for key words that you type in and, if the user's input contains words indexed in /topicInputs, it will launch an audio file found in /topicOuputs of Susan responding.

#How you can contribute
Feel free to modify Susan's code and upload your new and improved version to this repository by creating a a new branch. You can either fix a bug, add a new feature or add words and phrases to Susan's database.

#End Goal
The end goal of Susan V2 is to create a 'baby' AI which is ran on a Raspberry Pi built in a robot-like enclosure. It will:
- Run on start-up
- Have a realistic voice
- Support enough words to have a proper conversation
- Have multiple outputs for each input
